## What is this?

Atelier (French word for workbench or workshop) is a simple UI component explorer, like [angular-playground] [react-cosmos], [storybook], [styleguidist], [svench] or [chromatic].

A workbench help you implementing [Component Driven Development][cdd]: crafting reusable UI components in isolation.

Atelier is based on [Vite] JavaScript bundler.

## Getting started with Svelte

1. Install the plugin for Vite and Svelte bindings.

   ```shell
   npm i -D @atelier-wb/vite-plugin-atelier @atelier-wb/svelte
   ```

2. Register the plugin in `vite.config.js` file:

   ```js
   import svelte from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte'
   // other vite plugins
   import atelier from '@atelier-wb/vite-plugin-atelier'

   export default defineConfig({
     plugins: [svelte(), /* other plugins */ atelier()]
   })
   ```

3. Next to your `vite.config.js` file, creates a folder named `atelier`

4. Assuming the components you'd like to test is located in `src/MyComponent.svelte`, create a file names `atelier/MyComponent.tools.svelte` and set its content to:

   ```js
   <script>
     import { Tool } from '@atelier-wb/svelte'
     import MyComponent from '../src/MyComponent.svelte'
   </script>

   <Tool name="Components/My component" component={MyComponent} />
   ```

5. Start vite, and navigate to http://localhost:3000/atelier

6. To export your atelier as a static website in `dist-atelier` folder, run this command:

   ```shell
   vite build --mode export-atelier
   ```

   Expose it with a plain http server (`npx -y serve dist-atelier` for example) to enjoy it!

## Why another one?

Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room: _Storybook is a wonderful tool_.

In my experience, Storybook does not bring an enjoyable developer experience, mostly because of webpack (as the time of writing).
A lot of people throw a lot of effort to improve it for common cases, leading to powerfull starterkits like [create-react-app], and many blogpost (try searching for "storybook + nextjs" ðŸ˜‰).

However, if your project is not react-based, you're very likely to be forced rewriting an entire webpack configuration, leading to a very fragile and unefficient setup. On medium-sized code base, build time is significant, and becomes a barrier to CDD.

Atlier seamlessly integrates with [Vite][vitejs] bundler, and give you back control.
